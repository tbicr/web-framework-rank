## Score Calculation Algorithm
Score calculated as next way:
- calculate field score for framework for each field
  - for each field get framework value
  - order values from smallest to heights
  - field score for framework is index in ordered list starting from 1 divided to count of frameworks
- sum filed score of each field and divide to number of fields
- increase score to 100 to get result form 0 to 100

## Fields Used for Score Calculation
Next fields used to calculate score and rank it:
- last month package downloads from pypi
- projects on pypi with framework as main dependency
- stackoverflow questions for appropriate framework tag
- github stars
- unique committers
- lines updated last month
- unique committers last month
- last update in master (weeks from last update)
